# DynamicFlare

Update dynamic DNS entries for accounts on CloudFlare's DNS service.


## Installation

1. Clone this repository

2. `cd` into the root directory
```
cd dynamicflare
```

3. Create a python virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the created virtual environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Configuration

1. Create a CloudFlare API token as explained [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167836-Managing-API-Tokens-and-Keys). Use the `Edit zone DNS` template. In the `Zone Resources` section include the zones you want to update with this script.

2. Create a `config.json` file next to the `main.py` file in `dynamicflare` repository. 
`config.json` file must contain:
    - `cloudflare_token` - your CloudFlare API token
    - `records` - list of A record objects, each containing:
        - `domain` - base domain name for this A record
        - `record` - A record name

`config.json` example:
```
{
    "cloudflare_token": "_your_cloudflare_api_token_",
    "records": [
        {
            "domain": "domainone.com",
            "record": "domainone.com"
        },
        {
            "domain": "domainone.com",
            "record": "subone.domainone.com"
        },
        {
            "domain": "domaintwo.com",
            "record": "domaintwo.com"
        }
    ]
}
```


## Running

1. Create a new, or edit an existing, `crontab` file.
```bash
crontab -e
```

2. Add a command line which runs the script to the `crontab` file. I would suggest using full paths to the venv's python interpreter and to the python script. Here is an example which will run the script every 5 minutes:
```bash
*/5 * * * * /full/path/to/dynamicflare/venv/bin/python /full/path/to/dynamicflare/main.py
```

3. Verify your crontab file changes.
```bash
crontab -l
```


## Logging

1. Pipe the output of your cron command through logger so it ends up in the `syslog`. Add `2>&1 | logger -t dynamicflare` to the cron command:
```bash
*/5 * * * * /full/path/to/dynamicflare/venv/bin/python /full/path/to/dynamicflare/main.py 2>&1 | logger -t dynamicflare
```

2. Query `syslog` with the `dynamicflare` tag to see the logs:
```bash
grep "dynamicflare" /var/log/syslog
```
